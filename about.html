        <h3>MEET YOUR PROVIDER</h3>
        <p>
          Gloria, MSN, CRNP, FNP-C, CGCP
          Family Nurse Practitioner | Founder | Advocate for Accessible, Whole-Person Care
          Hi, I’m Gloria — a board-certified family nurse practitioner with over 15 years of experience delivering thoughtful, patient-centered care. I started this practice because I believe everyone deserves healthcare that is accessible, personal, and built around real life.
          After years of working within traditional healthcare systems, I saw the gaps — especially for homebound patients, seniors on Medicare or Medicaid, and busy families juggling care across multiple specialists. Too often, appointments were rushed, follow-up was hard to get, and the system felt more focused on billing codes than on actual healing.
          So I decided to build something different.
          A Better Way to Get Care
          <br/>I created this practice to bring full-scope family primary care directly to patients — whether you're homebound, managing chronic conditions, or simply prefer the ease and flexibility of telehealth. I treat adolescents through older adults, and I’m especially passionate about reaching underserved communities who face barriers to care.
          Right now, I’m offering virtual visits so you can get medical support from the comfort of your home — no waiting rooms, no rushing, and no bouncing between providers. Whether you’re a busy professional, a caregiver, or someone who struggles to leave home, I’m here to meet you where you are.
          <br/> What You Can Expect<br/>
          * Comprehensive family primary care<br/>
          * Chronic disease management and preventive care<br/>
          * Support for homebound Medicare & Medicaid patients<br/>
          * Convenient, compassionate telehealth appointments<br/>
          * A provider who truly listens — and follows through<br/>
          My Philosophy
          I believe in treating the whole person, not just isolated symptoms. That means understanding your story, working together on root causes, and creating a care plan that actually makes sense for your life. My goal is to build lasting relationships with patients — built on trust, transparency, and time.
          This isn’t just a job for me. It’s my calling. And while the healthcare system may be slow to change, I’m committed to doing my part — one patient, one visit, one meaningful connection at a time.
          
          
          
          Let’s talk about your care needs.
